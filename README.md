# PAR-PPF-DLI

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), Lumen, and Radiant Flux conversion Calculator
This calculates lighting as it is relevant between plants and humans using actual spectrum curves. This should be accurate for LED based grow lights as well as any other type of lighting as long as the spectrum is known. The lumen and PAR dependent numbers are calculated based on actual studies that measured the real world curves. 

The PAR curve is from Institute of Life Science and Biology Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, Texas (U.S.A.), the lumen curve is from Stockman & Sharpe cone fundamentals

Note: In this calculator radiant flux is calculated only over displayed wavelengths of 375-800nm. The Black Body Spectrum input clips the spectrum to be within 400-700nm. When using the black body spectrums the radiant flux is measured only over the 400-700nm range.

Radiant Flux is a measure of actual light output, and here it is a measure of actual light output over the given spectrum. When entering radiant flux, a rough estimate is ok.
